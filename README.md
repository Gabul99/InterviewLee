# InterviewLee

Job interview candidates, particularly new graduates, often express dissatisfaction with the limited resources available for the stressful interview preparation. While mock interviews, mentors, and study groups are valuable, the variability and quantity of materials remain insufficient. Furthermore, **standing out** in a competitive job market is crucial, yet there's a lack of reference samples for comparative evaluation. InterviewLee, a crowdsourcing platform, attempts to solve this issue by collecting and offering sufficient and high-quality interview questions and feedback. Also, InterviewLee attempts to incentivize the users who feel demotivated along the exhausting journey with gamification elements. To be more specific, InterviewLee takes the following approaches:

1. **Summary report** that analyzes the quality of the report in terms of *clarity*, *depth*, and likeliness to receive a *follow-up* question as well as the *uniqueness* of a user’s response in comparison to other users’ responses 
2. Request **feedback** and annotate on specific sections of a response to effectively collaborate with and learn from various users
3. Incentivize users through the gamification component, **********************Campus Rank**********************, which gets higher as users attempt more responses, successfully upload novel and relevant questions on the question board, give feedback, and actively use InterviewLee
